Matthew 5:16 @@In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
Lord, may Your Word be a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path, guiding us in the way of truth and righteousness. 
 (Corinthians 13:4-7) Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
