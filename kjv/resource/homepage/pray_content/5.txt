Matthew 7:12 @@So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
Lord,May Your grace be with us, enabling us to remain steadfast and peaceful in the face of challenges.
(Isaiah 41:10)So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
