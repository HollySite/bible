Ephesians 4:32 @@Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
Lord, May Your Word be a lamp unto our feet, guiding us in the path of truth and righteousness.
(Isaiah 41:10)Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
