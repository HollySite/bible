John 8:32 @@Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
Lord, may Your peace reign in our hearts, dispelling all anxiety and fear, and filling us with Your comfort and assurance.
(Ephesians 4:32) Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
