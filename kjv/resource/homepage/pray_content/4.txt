John 3:16 @@For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
Lord, thank you for giving us a new day. May we experience Your grace and guidance throughout this day.
(John 14:27)Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
